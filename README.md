RxJava Replaying Share
======================

`ReplayingShare` is an RxJava transformer which combines `replay(1)`, `publish()`, and `refCount()`
operators.

Unlike traditional combinations of these operators, `ReplayingShare` caches the last emitted
value from the upstream observable *only* when one or more downstream subscribers are connected.
This allows expensive upstream observables to be shut down when no one is subscribed while also
replaying the last value seen by *any* subscriber to new ones.

Apply with `compose` to an upstream observable and cache the resulting observable for new
subscribers.

```java
@Singleton class Chart {
  private final Observable<Bitmap> chart;

  @Inject ChartData(Observable<List<Data>> data) {
    chart = data.debounce(1, SECONDS)
        .map(list -> bigExpensiveRenderChartToBitmapFunction(list))
        .compose(ReplayingShare.instance());
  }

  Observable<Bitmap> data() {
    return chart;
  }
}
```
